      <p class="project-paragraph">
        For the first design sprint in our CS376 course, my team undertook the task of redesigning the Williams College Student Health Portal, focusing on transforming it into a mobile-friendly application particularly for atheletes. This portal serves as a crucial hub for managing health-related information, such as scheduling appointments, submitting forms, and reviewing medical histories. However, its existing design presents challenges, particularly for student-athletes who rely on the portal more frequently due to mandatory health requirements. By analyzing the portal's structure and pinpointing areas for improvement, we sought to streamline its usability and tailor it to better serve its audience, especially athletes.

        A significant aspect of this project was my personal growth in learning Figma for design purposes. Initially unfamiliar with the tool, I explored online resources, tutorials, and peer guidance to master its functionalities. This process underscored the importance of utilizing readily available resources to overcome skill gaps. Beyond Figma, I also delved into design principles, enabling me to create user-centered, visually appealing layouts. This hands-on learning enhanced my ability to adapt and tackle challenges efficiently.

        Collaboration played a vital role in our project. Each team member was responsible for critical design elements, contributing unique strengths to create a cohesive prototype. While one member focused on mood boards and color palettes, another worked on paper prototyping and finalizing layouts. Our iterative process allowed us to merge individual contributions seamlessly, ensuring a unified design that met our objectives. Regular feedback sessions facilitated effective communication and alignment of our ideas.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
      The design process itself proved to be enlightening. Starting with paper prototypes, we visualized and tested preliminary ideas before committing to digital designs. This iterative approach allowed us to refine our prototype progressively, addressing usability issues and incorporating feedback. The benefits of this method became clear as we shifted from sketches to a polished, functional prototype that reflected user needs. Tools like mood boards, inspired by successful apps and healthcare platforms, helped guide our decisions throughout the redesign.

       Most importantly, this project emphasized the importance of designing for users who may not share our experiences or perspectives. By identifying pain points specific to student-athletes and addressing them, we created a more inclusive and functional application. The redesign process taught us how to balance aesthetics with usability, ultimately solving problems that enhance the user experience. Our work not only improved the portal but also deepened our understanding of empathetic design.
