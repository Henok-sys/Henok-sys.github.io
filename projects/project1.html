        In my needfinding assignment, I explored how smartwatches are transforming personal 
      health technology by interviewing three individuals at Williams College. The focus 
      was on their experiences, motivations, and challenges in using these devices. 
      Smartwatches, valued for tracking vital health metrics like heart rate and sleep, 
      offer unique insights into users' daily routines and health awareness. Each participant 
      shared how these tools have enhanced their lives, from simplifying fitness tracking to 
      predicting illness through heart rate variability.

        The interviews also revealed significant challenges. While users appreciated features 
      like gentle alarms and health reminders, inaccuracies emerged in unexpected scenarios, 
      such as undercounting steps while pushing a stroller or misinterpreting activities as 
      sleep. Additionally, the high cost of smartwatches posed a barrier, making some question 
      the balance between their benefits and expenses. These limitations highlight opportunities 
      for innovation in accuracy and affordability.

        This assignment was a fascinating and valuable experience for me, as it deepened my understanding 
    of user needs and their critical role in designing or improving products. I also learned about 
    empathy maps as a powerful tool for organizing user insights and identifying areas for 
    innovation. Engaging with users helped me appreciate the importance of empathy in designing 
    impactful, user-centered solutions that effectively balance usability, cost, and functionality.
