        The design of "Running with Your Hands" focuses on creating an engaging and intuitive 
        interaction experience for the game Temple Run. The goal was to design a game that 
        not only engaged users physically but also made use of gesture-based controls to 
        create an innovative user interface. As we worked through the development process,
         we realized the importance of collaboration across various skillsets within our team. 
         We had different team members handling different aspects of the project, from the game 
         mechanics and design to the user interface and audience presentation. This was a rewarding 
         experience that not only allowed us to build a product but also to think strategically about 
         how to introduce it to users in an effective way.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Before diving into the design process, we conducted a thorough analysis of existing 
        games and artifacts in the gesture-based control space. Understanding the nature of 
        the game, its goals, and the interaction mechanics helped us determine how to effectively 
        integrate gesture controls into the gameplay. We also explored how users interact with 
        similar systems to ensure that our design was intuitive and engaging. By breaking down the 
        game’s mechanics and studying how players would likely approach the game, we gained valuable 
        insights into how to tailor the experience for both usability and fun.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        One of the most fascinating aspects of our project was conducting Wizard of Oz testing. 
        This formative testing method allowed us to simulate the functionality of the game’s 
        gesture controls without actually building the full system at first. It was a great 
        learning opportunity, as it helped us quickly identify usability issues and refine our 
        design decisions. Through this testing, we were able to observe how users reacted to the 
        idea of gesture-based controls and identify any areas where the interface or gameplay could
         be confusing or difficult to navigate. The insights we gained from this testing were 
         invaluable in shaping the final product.
      </p>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Throughout the design process, we focused on making the interaction as simple and 
        intuitive as possible for users. We wanted to ensure that players could easily understand 
        the controls and immerse themselves in the gameplay without being distracted by overly 
        complex mechanics or confusing gestures. By keeping the design simple and clear, we were 
        able to create a more engaging and enjoyable user experience. Our design choices, such as 
        minimizing the number of gestures required and focusing on natural movements, helped reduce 
        potential frustration and made the game accessible to a wider audience. Ensuring that our 
        code translates into an enjoyable experience for the user was a fun goal to pursue.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
      While we are proud of our design, we recognize that there is always room for improvement. 
      In retrospect, we could have chosen a different game or refined our choices to make the 
      interaction even more engaging. Nevertheless, this project was an invaluable learning 
      experience that helped us develop both technical and design skills. Working with gesture 
      libraries taught us important technical skills related to interaction design, while planning 
      and integrating features into a product helped us hone our design thinking. The process of 
      balancing functionality with user experience was both challenging and rewarding, and we look 
      forward to applying the lessons learned to future projects.
