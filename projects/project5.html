      <h3 class="project-title"> HelpMeStudy. An Extension that Makes a Difference.</h3>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The modern digital landscape offers unparalleled opportunities, yet it often demands users to navigate distractions that can erode productivity and well-being. Students, in particular, face challenges balancing online engagement with responsible habits, frequently encountering pitfalls like procrastination, doom-scrolling, or excessive social media use. Many online platforms amplify these tendencies by prioritizing engagement over user health, leaving users feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from their goals. To combat this, we developed HelpMeStudy, a browser extension aimed at fostering responsible online behavior. By tracking web activity, delivering timely reminders, and promoting intentional browsing, our extension empowers users to realign their digital habits with their personal and academic objectives.
      </p>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        This design sprint was particularly exciting as it was an open-ended assignment to create a tool that fosters responsibility. Our brainstorming phase began with several concepts, such as a deep work timer, a focus filter, and a gamified productivity tracker. After careful consideration, we settled on HelpMeStudy. Initially conceptualized as a pop-up quiz system to encourage studying, the idea evolved into a more practical time-tracking and notification-based tool. This transformation allowed us to address core user needs within a manageable scope, leveraging lessons in ideation, prototyping, and user-centered design.

      </figure>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The features we implemented were intentionally straightforward yet impactful. The time-tracking tool provides gentle reminders like, “Why not go to [USER INPUT SITE]?” to encourage users to refocus their efforts. Customizable notifications allow users to tailor intervals and recommended websites to their needs, promoting a balance between productivity and breaks. By applying design principles such as similarity and continuation, we ensured the extension’s interface was clear and intuitive.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        User feedback, gathered during testing, highlighted both strengths and areas for improvement. Many users appreciated the unobtrusive nature of the reminders and the clean design, which facilitated seamless interaction. However, there were challenges, such as notifications resetting when switching tabs and alerts appearing even when users were on productive sites. Suggestions for enhancements included persistent timers, more nuanced notification logic, and customizable focus site settings. We promptly addressed some of these issues, such as increasing default notification intervals to reduce distractions and noted the others in our design doc for possible future improvements.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        This project underscored the critical role of user testing in refining features. Observing testers interact with the extension revealed nuances we hadn’t anticipated, such as the need for better tab-tracking logic and cooldown periods between notifications. Testing other gesture-based tools further reinforced the importance of evaluation. By experiencing both the benefits and frustrations of competing products, we gained deeper insights into how even minor design flaws could undermine user satisfaction. This understanding emphasized the value of iterative testing and evaluation in creating effective solutions.
      </p>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Our experience with HelpMeStudy demonstrated how lightweight tools, like browser extensions, can make a tangible impact on promoting responsible digital habits. The iterative process of designing, testing, and refining features was instrumental in ensuring the extension met user expectations while remaining adaptable to diverse needs. Moving forward, we aim to incorporate additional features, such as categorizing websites into productivity tiers and providing detailed analytics to help users understand their habits over time.
      </p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        This sprint not only equipped us with technical skills but also reinforced the importance of user-centered design and continuous evaluation. The journey from concept to implementation was both challenging and rewarding, and the lessons we learned will undoubtedly influence our approach to future projects.
