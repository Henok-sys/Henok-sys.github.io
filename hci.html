      <h2>CS376: Human Computer Interaction</h2>
        <p>
          In my Human-Computer Interaction (CS376) class at Williams College, we delved 
          into the key elements of design from multiple perspectives, including interactivity, 
          effectiveness, responsibility, and accessibility. Throughout the course, we adopted 
          a user-centered mindset, which guided our approach to understanding the intricacies 
          of design. The class involved hands-on activities and projects that allowed us to deeply 
          analyze these elements and interpret them within real-world contexts. One of the core
           aspects of the class was engaging in four design sprints: Design for Others, Design 
           for Interaction, Design for Effectiveness, and Design for Responsibility. These sprints 
           provided a structured framework through which we could explore design principles and apply
            them to our projects.
        </p>

        <p>
           The course also helped me hone several project development skills, including planning, 
           time and resource management, collaboration, and iterative development. We worked in 
           teams, which fostered a collaborative environment and helped us understand how to
            coordinate efforts efficiently. A unique aspect of the course was the roleplaying 
            activity, where we simulated the experience of being a diverse group of individuals
             in a product development team, aiming to deliver a high-quality product. This
              activity not only emphasized the importance of communication but also showcased
               the challenges of balancing differing perspectives and needs during the design 
               process.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Beyond the theoretical knowledge and technical skills, the class 
              encouraged real-world application. We were tasked with exploring our campus 
              environment, identifying accessible and inaccessible features, and testing 
              our designs with students and faculty members. This allowed us to see how our
               work could directly impact the user experience and make a tangible difference. 
               Additionally, we documented our design processes through detailed Medium posts, 
               which further developed our documentation and organizational skills. Overall, 
               CS376 provided a comprehensive understanding of HCI principles and prepared us 
               for the practical challenges designers and developers face in real-life projects.
